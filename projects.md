### 2. **SDU Postomat**
- **Description**: The SDU Postomat project aims to streamline food shopping for students by enabling pre-ordering and pickup via a mobile app and Food Locker system, reducing wait times and improving convenience.
- **My Role**: In this project, my role was to lead the data collection and analysis phase. I conducted interviews, prepared the questionnaire, and observed the process at different times of the day. I then analyzed the data and identified key issues like queue management, service limitations, and underuse of self-service machines. I also contributed to the design solutions, suggesting features like a Postomat-based order pickup system and visible price tags.
