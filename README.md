# Hi, I'm **Asemay Rasilkhan**!

I'm a UX/UI designer with a passion for creating user-centered, aesthetically pleasing, and functional designs. My goal is to design intuitive and visually appealing interfaces that solve real user problems.

## About Me

With over **3 years of experience** in UX/UI design, I specialize in creating user-friendly interfaces that combine form and function. I work with tools like **Figma**, **Adobe XD**, and **Sketch**, and employ methods such as **prototyping**, **UI design**, and **user research** to create effective solutions.

- **Experience**: 3+ years in UX/UI design.
- **Skills**: Prototyping, Wireframing, User Research, Usability Testing.
- **Languages**: English, Russian (add any other languages if applicable).

## My Design Approach

I believe that great design is not just about aesthetics—it’s about solving real user problems. My design process is centered around:
1. **Research**: Understanding user needs through research and feedback.
2. **Iterations**: Prototyping and testing solutions based on real-world usage.
3. **Problem Solving**: Creating solutions that are both usable and visually appealing.

## My Projects

In the [Projects](projects.md) section, you’ll find a showcase of my key projects. These highlight my design approach and problem-solving techniques, and demonstrate how I translate complex user requirements into simple, intuitive designs.
