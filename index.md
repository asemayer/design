# Hi, I'm Asemay Rasilkhan!

I'm someone who enjoys creating designs that are both easy to use and look good. My goal is to make sure interfaces are simple, functional, and visually appealing to the users.

## About Me

I’ve been involved in UX/UI design as part of my general area electives. I have experience with tools like **Figma** and **Sketch**, and I’ve worked with basic design principles and user feedback to create solutions that people can easily understand and use.

- **Experience**: I worked for a year as a quality control manager, which helped me understand the importance of details and usability.
- **Skills**: Prototyping, Wireframing, User Research, Usability Testing.
- **Languages**: English.

## My Design Approach

I believe that great design is not just about aesthetics—it’s about solving real user problems. My design process is centered around:
1. **Research**: Understanding user needs through research and feedback.
2. **Iterations**: Prototyping and testing solutions based on real-world usage.
3. **Problem Solving**: Creating solutions that are both usable and visually appealing.

## My Projects

In the [Projects](projects.md) section, you can check out some of the projects I’ve worked on. They show how I take feedback and make designs that fit the users' needs while keeping things simple.
