# Hi, I'm Asemay Rasilkhan!

I'm someone who enjoys creating designs that are both easy to use and look good. My goal is to make sure interfaces are simple, functional, and visually appealing to the users.

## About Me

I’ve been involved in UX/UI design as part of my general area electives. I have experience with tools like **Figma** and **Sketch**, and I’ve worked with basic design principles and user feedback to create solutions that people can easily understand and use.

- **Experience**: I worked for a year as a quality control manager, which helped me understand the importance of details and usability.
- **Skills**: Prototyping, Wireframing, User Research, Usability Testing.
- **Languages**: English.

## My Design Approach
