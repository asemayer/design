# Hi, I'm **Asemay Rasilkhan**!

I'm someone who enjoys creating designs that are both easy to use and look good. My goal is to make sure interfaces are simple, functional, and visually appealing to the users.

## About Me

I’ve been involved in UX/UI design as part of my general area electives. I have experience with tools like **Figma**, **Adobe XD**, and **Sketch**, and I’ve worked with basic design principles and user feedback to create solutions that people can easily understand and use.

- **Experience**: I worked for a year as a quality control manager, which helped me understand the importance of details and usability.
- **Skills**: Prototyping, Wireframing, User Research, Usability Testing.
- **Languages**: English, Russian (add any other languages if applicable).

## My Design Approach

To me, design is about more than just looking good—it’s about solving problems in ways that make things easier for the user. Here’s how I approach it:
1. **Research**: Learning what users need and what works best for them.
2. **Iterations**: Testing out different ideas and adjusting them based on feedback.
3. **Problem Solving**: Finding solutions that are easy to use and visually nice.

## My Projects

In the [Projects](projects.md) section, you can check out some of the projects I’ve worked on. They show how I take feedback and make designs that fit the users' needs while keeping things simple.
